### What controls does the game support?

Retro Paddle Ball supports multiple input methods:

| Input Type | Control Scheme                |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| Keyboard   | Arrow keys or `<(,)` and `>(.)` |
| Gamepad    | D-Pad / Left Analog Stick    |
| Touch      | Drag paddle directly         |
| Mouse      | Move paddle horizontally     |

The game automatically detects your input method and adapts accordingly.

### Why did you create this game?

This game started as a passion project when my kids asked: "Can you build a game like the ones we play on RetroArch?" It's a reminder that no matter how busy life gets, we can always create something meaningful and fun.

### Are you making the source code open?

Not right now. While I believe in the spirit of open source, I'm currently keeping the code closed while I clean up and refactor the codebase. I'm happy to share learnings and answer technical questions, but the complete source isn't publicly available yet.

### Did you use AI to build this game?

Yes, I used tools like GitHub Copilot and OpenAI to accelerate certain aspects of development. However, AI is not a silver bullet - creativity, quality, and engineering decisions still required deep human thought and problem-solving.
