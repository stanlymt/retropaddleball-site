### What controls does the game support?

Retro Paddle Ball supports multiple input methods for both single-player and two-player modes:

#### Keyboard Controls
- **Single Player:**
  - ‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è Left/Right Arrow Keys: Move paddle left and right
  - üî§ A/D Keys: Move aiming line left and right
  - üöÄ Space/Enter: Launch the ball

- **Two Player (additional):**
  - ‚å®Ô∏è Comma/Period Keys: Move top paddle left and right
  - üéØ Z/C Keys: Move aiming line for top paddle left and right

*Note: For two-player mode, keyboard is not recommended as the primary input method for both players.*

#### Gamepad Controls
- üïπÔ∏è D-Pad Left/Right or Left Stick: Move your paddle
- üîò Left/Right Bumpers (LB/RB): Move aiming line
- üî´ Right Trigger (RT): Launch the ball

*Same controls apply to both players with their assigned gamepads.*

#### Touch Controls
- üëÜ Touch and drag on the paddle or use the paddle control buttons: Move your paddle
- üîÑ Touch and drag on the ball: Adjust the aim direction
- üëã Release the ball after dragging: Launch the ball

*Same gestures apply to both players in two-player mode.*

#### Mouse Controls
- üñ±Ô∏è Click and drag on the paddle or use the paddle control buttons: Move your paddle
- üîÑ Click and drag on the ball: Adjust the aim direction
- üëÜ Release the ball after dragging: Launch the ball

The game automatically detects your input method and adapts accordingly.

### Why did you create this game?

This game started as a passion project when my kids asked: "Can you build a game like the ones we play on RetroArch?" It's a reminder that no matter how busy life gets, we can always create something meaningful and fun.

### Are you making the source code open?

Not right now. While I believe in the spirit of open source, I'm currently keeping the code closed while I clean up and refactor the codebase. I'm happy to share learnings and answer technical questions, but the complete source isn't publicly available yet.

### Did you use AI to build this game?

Yes, I used tools like GitHub Copilot and OpenAI to accelerate certain aspects of development. However, AI is not a silver bullet - creativity, quality, and engineering decisions still required deep human thought and problem-solving.

## Game Tips & Tricks

Improve your gameplay with these expert tips:

### Paddle Control
- üî∂ **Edge vs Center:** The ball will bounce at different angles depending on where it hits your paddle. Hit with the edge for sharper angles or the center for more predictable bounces.
- ‚ö° **Quick Movements:** Short, precise movements are better than large sweeps. Keep your paddle centered when possible.
- üéØ **Sweet Spot:** Find the paddle's 'sweet spot' that gives you the most control over ball direction.

### Aiming
- üìê **Angle Planning:** Use the aiming controls to set up the perfect shot before launching. This can give you a strategic advantage, especially in two-player matches.
- üß† **Think Ahead:** Plan your shots 2-3 bounces in advance, like in chess.
- üé≠ **Fake-outs:** Change your aim direction at the last moment to throw off your opponent.

### Scoring System
- üéØ **Precision:** Points are awarded based on how close to the center of your paddle the ball hits. Perfect center hits earn maximum precision points!
- üßò **Control:** Keep your paddle steady when hitting the ball to earn control bonuses. Wild, jerky movements reduce your control score.
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Balance:** Roughly 65% of your score comes from precision and 35% from control. A perfect hit combines both factors for maximum points.

### Extra Lives
- üí´ **Excellent Hits:** Hits that score above a certain threshold are considered 'excellent' and count toward earning extra lives.
- üîÑ **Sliding Window:** The game tracks your recent excellent hits in a sliding window of 8 attempts.
- üèÜ **Consistency Reward:** Score 5 excellent hits within this window to earn an extra life!

### Game Strategy
- üèÜ **Competitive Edge:** In two-player mode, force your opponent to the edges of their paddle for harder returns.
- üß© **Pattern Recognition:** Watch for patterns in your opponent's play style and adjust accordingly.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Defensive Play:** When under pressure, focus on making a clean return rather than a perfect shot.
