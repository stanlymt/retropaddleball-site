# üïπÔ∏è From Retro Memories to a Modern Learning Journey

![Game Screenshots Collage](/assets/screenshots-collage.png)

A few months ago, I started a side project‚Äîa simple paddle ball game‚Äîfor my kids. They love playing on RetroArch and asked, **"Can you build one just for us?"** That question brought back memories of my early days coding DOS games in C++ at age 12, and rekindled a passion I hadn't touched in years.

I used C++20 and SDL3 to build a fully functional multi-platform game that runs on:

- üñ•Ô∏è **macOS & Windows**
- üì± **Android phones & tablets**
- üì∫ **Android TVs** (yes, even your 80-inch!)

It supports keyboard, touch, gamepad, and mouse input‚Äîdynamically adapting to each screen and device.

## More Than Just a Game

This project isn't just about the game.

It's a personal reminder that even with a full-time job, family responsibilities, and leadership commitments, you can still carve out time to build, learn, and play.

Along the way, I rediscovered the value of deep focus, debugging under constraints, and learning in the open. And as an engineering leader, it reinforced what I believe: that great leadership and technical depth aren't mutually exclusive.

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">The Tech Behind the Game</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">I utilized tools like GitHub Copilot and OpenAI to accelerate the process, but every challenge still required some good old-fashioned human creativity, clarity, and care. Engineering decisions definitely require a lot of thoughtful input!</p>
  
  <h4 class="font-bold mt-4">Technical Stack:</h4>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2">
    <li>C++20 for core game logic</li>
    <li>SDL3 for cross-platform rendering and input</li>
    <li>Custom physics engine for smooth ball movement</li>
    <li>Adaptive UI scaling for different screen sizes</li>
    <li>Platform-specific optimizations</li>

## About Me

I'm an engineering leader with 20+ years of experience scaling products, platforms, and people across global organizations, including Paylocity, Microsoft, Oracle, and Schneider Electric. I specialize in building high-performing teams, shaping technical strategy, and delivering outcomes that matter, whether in modernizing legacy systems or leading multi-organization platform integrations.

At Paylocity, I founded and scaled the Position Management team in Prague. Over the course of two years, I delivered foundational HR features‚ÄîMultiple Positions support, Real-Time Mutation Events, Access Group Automation, and Observability Dashboards‚Äîand led a pivotal enterprise integration with Airbase. From zero to launch, I shipped 90% of scope six weeks ahead of MVP, proving that a lean team with the right guardrails can deliver outsized impact.

### What Drives Me

I'm driven by a desire to build with purpose‚Äîto create systems and teams that are not just functional, but resilient, scalable, and deeply aligned with customer needs. I find meaning in developing people, shaping cohesive team cultures, and solving hard problems with simple, elegant solutions.

If you're a fellow engineering/product/technology leader exploring platform modernization, international team building, or scaling org capabilities, I'd love to connect and exchange ideas.

Let's build the future, better.
